# DAVE hardware

Welcome to the hardware section of the DAVE project! This repository contains all the necessary information, schematics, designs, and embedded code related to the hardware components of our AI glasses.

## Overview

The hardware consists of various components carefully integrated to provide users with an immersive and intelligent experience. From ultrasonic sensors to gyroscopes, every aspect of the hardware is designed to enhance the user's interaction with the enviornment around them. We are specifically targeting
our product to those who are visually impaired.

## Features

- **Proximity Detection**: Our glasses are capable of detecting the nearest obstacle to the user and which direction they shoud go.
- **Visual Direction**: Through use of a gyroscope, DAVE uses the tilt and orientation of the glasses to tell users  the direction in which they are looking.
- **Audio Feedback**: Equipped with a speaker, users can be verbally alerted and informed by our technology based on the data it collects.
- **OLED Display**: An integrated OLED screen allows system information displayed on the side of the glasses as well as add some personality via fun, unique text!
- **Start Up Sequence**: Users are greeted by a distinct, fun LED show, audio queue, and "DAVE ON!" text to tell them the glasses are on. 
- **Voltmeter**: A module capable of self-regualting battery life via a voltage divider. 
- **Battery Control**: The user is able to easily to turn on and off our glasses with a flick of a switch and recharge the battery through the microcontroller.
